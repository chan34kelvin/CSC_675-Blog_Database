I know what you mean about learning some of the truly important life lessons that we couldnt possibly understand at an earlier time. 

I just posted about one that really hit home in one of my blogs, <a href=http://lifejourney.typepad.com/synchronicity_a_gogo rel=nofollow>Synchronicity a Go-Go</a>, about not giving in to negativity that you may find interesting.

While I enjoy your blog very much, I do have one request. Would you mind changing your font color to the next darkest gray? It would certainly improve contrast and, in turn, readability ergonomics and usability are two of my things. This change would certainly make your blog easier for these old eyes to read!

Thanks for giving life to us older gals, whom so many consider societal throwaways. Not! ;-

Cheers,

A core of people have joined him each year for decades, and after theyve gone through the happy and the sorrowful and the angry moments of the year, they pull down a carousel though in a few years theyll be calling up a digital file, I suppose from 5 years earlier, 10 years earlier, 15 years earlier, and so on, to see how things have changed, and how they have not. Who has left their lives, and who has entered. The hosts birthday is New Years Day, and this is as much as anything his ritual of self-taking. So then, at the end, he pulls down the carousel with his birthday self-portraits, taken in a mirror, beginning thirty some years ago.

Im 41 and have refused the lie that falsely illumines societys views on aging-[especially for women]and just what beauty is. 

It was in my mid-late 30s that I began to really put the person God created ahead of the person I created and wisdom began to kick-in.  SOOO much time is wasted worrying about such trivialities as how to measure up-at least in my case throughout my life.  If young women  read the kinds of insights like you have posted here, may they save a few years of turmoil!  I must say, as a ray of hope, Ive noticed a growing-away from these falsehoods by many of the young women Ive been in contact with.   

The biggest hurdle to overcome and hard-wire into our psyche..its not about me..There is so much MORE to that statement than most people can comprehend, I still remind myself of this ohh, every so often.

Ultimately, we are respondsible for our OWN happiness-no man-[generic term for humans]-has the power to  make us happy-[generic for feelings of self-worth, and many other blanks can be filled in here]-UNLESS we ourselves give that power to someone, the choice is ours to make.  Now THAT was a real hard one for me to really grasp... 

Thank you for your insights Ronnie.

All the best to you,

Although Im an RN and understand the aging process, its very difficult when that aging involves a loved one.

My 79 yr. old aunt moved in with us in Nov. 2003, after her husband died.  They had no children and I was her favorite niece.

This is the aunt who I admired all my life, who owned her own business, who was a fashion plate, who traveled the world and in 95 we spent a wonderful week together in Paris.  This is the aunt that was an avid reader, THEE most proficient knitter.  The woman who when she retired, went on to volunteer for 20 years at a local hospital.

And now....her days consist of sitting in her recliner following breakfast watching The Waltons, Little House, Matlock.  The books I gave her for Christmas sit untouched.  Her needlepoint and knitting remain in her tote bag...untouched.  

Those conversations like you had with Aunt Edith and the interest shown...gone.  I miss that woman and I believe Ive been angry that shes gone.  Despite all my nurses training and working, Ive had a difficult time understanding why everything has changed so dramatically.  

Reading what you wrote here makes such perfect sense to me, I cant believe I didnt grasp it myself.  But I love that old saying....When the student is ready, the teacher appears.

", '2004-04-09'),(12,"steve lozano","I totally agree with your assessment. Our generation, boomers are not satisfied with just aging and hanging it up when we hit 60. However, my take is that it is generational development. Our parents were happy growing up with shelter, a meal and retirement was icing on the cake. They earned the right to lay on their butts.  The boomer generation did not worry about shelter and food. We seek meaning to our lives thus continuing the quest for contribution and a legacy. I also believe that our children will exceed our expectations and begin solving our more significant global issues in their lifetimes, global warming, hunger and health.

To say we did not seek meaning in theirour lives is a naive gross understatement that reinforces many false stereotypical images of older people which are dispelled here if you will take the time to read more of the TGB posts on Ageism. 

I agree with Mary Ann, that Boomers, as adults, are responsible for their own attitudes cant blame Mommy and Daddy including those striving to be forever young in appearance.

All that said, I think we do a great injustice to older people and to Boomers, when we portray either group by narrow stereotypical images. On an individual basis, both groups share far more common ground than we are led to believe.

", '2004-04-20'),(13,"listener","At the risk of injecting a bit of common sense into the discussion....

Edwards made the rounds frequently on fundrasining trips to benefit local NPR stations. Anyone who saw him in Q&amp;A will recall his answers to questions that indicated a very strong aversion to leaving the studio for stories. Compare this with the current crisp bi-coastal presentation by Inskeep and Montagne.

When Edwards was fired he was 57. One of his replacements, Montagne, was 56. Wertheimer, Stamberg, Roberts, Totenberg, Schoor,Adams, McPartland and God knows how many more on air range in age from their late 50s to their 80s. Ageism my ass.

Edwards was one of the most miserable interviewers it has been my displeasure to hear in my 55 years. Unless the subject was sports he displayed a lack of animation and tendency to toss softballs initially and for follow up that rivals CNNs Larry King.

The abysmal manner in which his departure was reportedly handled should not overshadow the fact that it was long overdue.
", '2004-04-20'),(13,"charlie summers","&gt; At the risk of injecting a bit of common sense into the discussion....

If by common sense you mean lies and distortion, youve certainly succeeded. Youve posted almost identical lies on various websites across the net under a variety of aliases, which makes me wonder if you arent really an NPR lacky desperately trying to rewrite history. I see you have at last backed off of your contention that Edwards resisted a co-host not only is this untrue, it was the only issue on which he threatened a lawsuit, which forced NPR to back down and issue to all member stations a retraction of its lies on the subject, and his strong aversion to leaving the studio translates into a reasonable reluctance to parachute into stories and take them over from the reporters who know them best. This seems perfectly reasonable to me - I want my anchor introducing those who cover the story, not jumping unprepared into the middle of them. If I wanted that nonsense, Id watch the networks who <em>love</em> to shove their anchors into embarassing situations for a few ratings points.

Whether the new morning zoo, with its loud, confrontational hosts and short-attention-span story roll is preferable to a calm intelligent entry into the morning is a matter of personal taste. That Edwards is one of the finest interviewers in the country is not at issue, however, and constantly repeating how miserable he is doesnt change that. His ability to keep himself from being the focus of attention, allowing the guests to actually get a word in edgewise without paraphrasing them contrast and compare <em>On Points</em> Tom Ashcroft, who loves the sound of his own voice - no wonder NPR decided to co-produce the show while forcing WGBH to dump the more balanced <em>The Connection</em> is unparalleled. He confronts without being confrontational, drawing out information gently and without drawing attention to the interviewer.

As to his alleged inability to handle stories outside the studio, that too is nonsense. On this mornings program, he traveled to Fort Missoula, Montana to interview World War II Italian detainees. It was an excellently-produced hour of radio, providing more driveway moments in that hour than the new NPR morning show has since its inception.

Those who disagree strongly with listeners comments, and miss the quiet authority of Bob Edwards  on your local public radio station should write and call them, asking them to carry the new <em>Bob Edwards Weekend,</em> a PRI-distributed two-hour compilation of his daily <a href=http://www.xmpr.org/ rel=nofollow>XM Satellite Radio</a> program starting January 6, 2006. It wont be as good as subscribing to XM to hear him every weekday morning, but its at least some way for the local stations to apologize for being so spineless when the NPR pinstripes replaced him as <em>Morning Edition</em> host.

Solo Exhibition: SKIN DEEP, contemporary portraits of women

A collection of recent paintings and drawings by Daniel Mark Duffy

Description:

The work to be presented in September of 2007 will be the aesthetic culmination of a reverentially connective expedition taken with women over 40 years of age.  His primary objective has been to intimately celebrate  the women represented via an extraordinary collaborative journey that has enabled him to create uncompromisingly feminine contemporary portraits.  Duffy deftly attempts to resurrect ancient traditions of goddess and fertility worship through the utilization of a classical realist painterâs brush.  

This collaboration with 25 women of varied cultures circumvents many of the disturbing misogynistic pitfalls and the resulting nude or partially nude  portraits reflect that consciousness.  Exquisitely realized, his paintings and drawings of women emerge authentically as empowered citizens of the world.  Their eyes and narrative poses engage with a resonant truth, vulnerability  and strength that insist the viewer appreciate all they are without submitting to or permitting  devaluation or objectification.  

As the reality of horrific abuses and unrelenting degradation persist against women in far too many cultures throughout the world, these portraits rise in defiant testament.

Daniel Mark Duffy recognized that the maturing woman is often dismissed and or devalued in contemporary Western culture.  He contends that the majority of mainstream media IE. press, advertising and films consistently present a minimized commercially relentless  image of a young slender version of âwomanâ which has come to represent an inevitably destructive and marginalized iconic ideal.  This trend can and has had a devastating effect, minimization of physical diversity that disables or short-circuits emotional development and self esteem, encourages discrimination and often may divert  attention from oneâs authentic purpose.   

The mature woman, whether she be full-figured or thin, mother, daughter and or sister, heterosexual or lesbian, gray haired or coiffed, smooth skinned or magnificently creased with history are honored in this collection of faces and forms.  Through his realist approach the artist asks the viewer to embrace the familiar yet often overlooked beauty of these mature women and to recognize a life-affirming truth that resonates in a cosmetically unedited celebration of our aging vessels.  This new body of work by the artist Daniel Mark Duffy steps onto the field to engage those who would prefer or have been conditioned to dismiss the mature woman and  invites us to share with the world the reality, the power, the truth and the beauty of their legitimacy.

Daniel Mark Duffy is a world-class portrait artist whose work hangs in many of Americaâs finest private, corporate, academic and institutional collections.

 Until I found yours, I came across very few sites that talk about aging.  Hurrah for your banner.

Male #2 is your age, and also good looking lets see -- looks like Johnny Depp for the 40 somethings, Richard Gere for 50s, Harrison Ford or Sean Connery for 60+ -- fill in whomever you wish, and he is also in the top 10% income level in his field, is intelligent, well-educated, experienced, loves children &amp; knows how to change a diaper!, very honest -- hes quieter than the young guy but just as, if not more, passionate WITHOUT Viagra.  Oh and he IS single, not a conniver with some poor wife hidden away somewhere.

Hmmm -- wouldnt most of you women take the guy your own age?  As a matter of fact, doesnt he seem too good to be true?

HOWEVER - I sincerely believe that if we rewrote the above gender-reversed: 



female number 1 is under 25 years old,  very cute &amp; a healthy beautiful body like an Britney Spears or a Jessica Simpson, maybe Natalie Portman, and kind of fun to talk to but . . .broke, working at the local WaWa, and can be self-centered and, well, kind of dumb sometimes.

female #2 is your age, and also good looking lets see -- looks like Julianne Moore for the 40 somethings, Susan Sarandon for 50s, Candace Bergen or Catherine DeNeuve for 60+ -- fill in whomever you wish, and she is also in the top 10% income level in her field, is intelligent, well-educated, experienced, loves children &amp; knows how to change a diaper!, very honest -- shes quieter than the young guy but just as, if not more, passionate WITHOUT hormone supplements.  And she is single.

So, men, who do you want to make some future romantic plans with?  

Of course, the men on this particular blog are probably a cut well above the average American male -- but, as a high-earning good-looking intelligent and HONEST 40-something woman, I can say, from experience, that most males act like I am not even there when some 20-something in tight clothes walks by.

It is wonderful going out with a group of women and we do not always tell dirty jokes well sometimes we do, and some of us do have a glass or two of wine, but so what.

1 Women Baby Boomers -- and if you want to hate an appellation, hate that one ... an entire generation castigated for simply being born! -- are busy people, and a lot of us from that era were asked to do it all if we also wanted or had to work outside the home -- so we did. In doing it all, many of us didnt have time for pure socialization, which the Red Hat Society seems to provide. That should be enough justification to get some of you free spirits off their backs.

2 I went to college in the non-conformist, hippie era of the 70s. Guess what the revolutionaries ALL wore? Army fatigue jackets and ragged bell bottoms. Just another uniform, love beads optional. 

3 A distressing thought: perhaps the invisibility cloak society hands to women on their 40th birthday or thereabouts in this up-to-here, down-to-there sex-addled society is purple just to see if anybody will notice. You probably wont believe this if you havent received your Birthday Cloak yet, but it is a relief to know that you never have to buy tampons, pantyhose, lip liner, or push-up bras anymore. Really.

3 Does it worry ANYBODY that thousands of obviously lovely and accomplishedalbeit in some cases FAT -- so, Pepper, step forward and accept your Queen of Mean tiara women feel underappreciated? Or need some sort of community other than mainstream society?

A lot of women are looking for new friends because at our ages friends retire and move to new locations.  Our Crimson Chicks have been an active organization since 2001.  We have developed many close friends who sometimes get together away from meetings.  We are a mix of married, widowed, single, divorced and we have

a wide age span.  It works well for us.

We once had a Valentines cruise where husbands and friends were invited. Our Queens husband is known

as Mr. Wonderful and because I didnt want to call my husband by the same fun title I call him Mr. Terrific.

Mr. G.Y. Terrific! Thats Mr. Gee Youre Terrific! He encourages my participation and sometimes buys a Red Hat

gift for me.  He even told one of the women where he worked that she should check it out.  She has become my

traveling buddy when we take Red Hat trips out of town about once a year.

We had a Puppy Shower for one of our members and that little puppy is now an adult dog who comes to our meetings in his bag.  He hangs around on the back of his Moms chair until after lunch and then makes his appearance.

Our chapter includes women from several cities around Clearwater, FL.  If you would like to attend one of our meetings; well, just reply by email.

Hope you have a wonderful day and find out more about HAttitude!

Thats what its ALL about. NOT being embarrased, Not caring that everyone is wear the same thing .. and having fun.Women because of society have always been presured into PERFECT behavior, PERFECT hair, PERFECT looks AND worring about what theyre wearing for fear someone has the same color or style on as they do. Jenny Josephs poem IS ABOUT shunning ALL that and NOT caring. Realizing that non of that is important, was IS important is getting the most out of life. And for some if it wasnt for places like The Red Hat Society, they would not leave their homes because they no longer have the energy to be PERFECT.I speak from experience.

As for myself, Im delighted to be a Queen in one chapter and a Lady in 3 others.  We certainly do not dress alike!  Some are very conservative while others are far out!  I love the sparkle, boas, royal titles, fun, and attitude.  

Those who see us gather often make wonderfully joyful comments.  One day, I was with another Red Hatter in a parking lot while we awaited more to join us for a trip to an ice cream shop in the next county. While we were blowing bubbles along a busy highway with the purple ribbon on my red hat blowing in the wind, a man in his 40s made a detour to see what all the fun was about!  

Later that day at said Ice Cream Shoppe, we were approached by a younger woman who brought her 92 yr. old grandfather over because he wanted to meet us!  He had been listening to our laughter and delighted to see us play dress up.  Our wonderful day was made even better.

Unfortunately Red Hatters arent any different than all other women. There are kind members and nasty members...just like in the PTA, the workforce and yes, the church. Being a member of the Red Hat Society just gives you the freedom to loosen your inhibitions a little...Kind of like wearing a costume and mask. 

I have been a member for 4 years and have met women of all races and faiths. We have partied together, worked for charitable causes together and cried together. A few years ago, I had the opportunity to share my room with a complete stranger at a convention. The member in question hadnt made reservations because she had recently had serious surgery for cancer and her doctor did not think she would be well enough. At the last minute, he decided that if she rested often and took care of herself, she could attend. By then the hotel was booked. I got to know a brave lady and pray with her and pray for her. Three months after the affair, she lost her battle and through my tears, I still had a smile in my heart for the short time I got to spend with her and pleasure that I had helped her escape her pain and enjoy herself for a short time. 

My parents raised me to be tolerant of others....and that means all others...those who enjoy being a member of the Red Hat Society and those who enjoy bashing all groups, ideas, and people who do not share their beliefs.

My chapter has eight members currently. The youngest one is 68. Seven are widows. Six were alone and depressed. Now, all are volunteers at the local hospital and get together with each other often between Red Hat meetings just because they enjoy each others company.

I pray all you critics never find yourself approaching 70, alone, scared, and depressed.

For you ladies who want to know how to join, log on to redhatsociety.com. If you cant find an open group, start your own. Thats what the rest of us did.

We all have our own chapters, make our own rules and wear whatever we darn well please.  Were all different, but for the most part we drink, we curse, we raise money for organizations in need and we are loyal to the motto of Be particular.  We organized thousands of dollars $33,000+ for Katrina victims, sent gift packages to Queens in the gulf, and even organized trips to help out those in need.

It never occurred to me that so many people think of it as a group that dresses alike.  I am only 27 years old and have known a little about the society for a few years--to me it symbolizes friendship more than anything.  I have seen some of these groups at various restaraunts around town just having fun and celebrating whatever holiday is around the corner--they were wearing red hats, but none were dressed alike.  Its sad that you all keep saying that they dont stand for the poem they claim--I think you all are misinterpretting the poem--its not about DRESSING alike--its about breaking away from the social restrictions society places on people over 50--so what if they do it in the same way as the other members of the group--they are still paving the way for those of us who dont want to just grow old gracefully but rather enjoy and embrace it all...stop focusing on what you perceive as the negative aspects of the organization and just be happy that these women have found FRIENDS with whom to share their lifes joys.

And Im only 45...I am a Pink Hatter and will be proud to join these ladies officially and meet up with them every chance I have.  

The Purple outfits and red hats are an outer expression of something far more important that is going on inside of each one of us.  It just means..we laugh, we live, we love and we want to share a few hours once a month to get away from the daily grind and share joy and happiness with others.  Today we made chocolate at a chocolate factory and then had a great seafood lunch down the street. Each chapter from what I understand is as unique and different as  any one person.  There are some chapters that I probably would never want to be a part of...but then there are a whole host of chapters that look like they are right up my alley: Its like grocery stores..you find one that you like and you feel comfortable with :   

But for me , its even more...you see, I have been living with Lupus for 14 years and just now got the diagnosis of MS on top of that.  No one in the group knew of this except my lunch partner.  What this group gave me today is priceless...it gave me laugther, it gave me interest and it gave me hope..and I had 5 hours of not even thinking of my health.  My hubby was so happy that I was able to get up and get going. It made a load of difference in my outlook. Im happier!

 This isnt just a bunch of non-conformist conformists its a group of women from 45-70 that care about each other..and who want to live life to their best.   They are their to help each other and reach out to the community.  They are varied in faith, ethnicity and politics...but they are unified by friendship.  

Sure, Im sure Im going to probably meet someone I wont get along with, but thats no different than someone at church, or any other type of group settings.  Thats just human nature.  

I intend to do all I can to grow old gracefully but with a lot of fun and a big smile on my face, and wearing the pink/lavendar for now proudly, and I will be really glad to wear the Purple and Red when I hit 50!!

She said before joining our group, she spent her days in a recliner watching television and waiting to die. Now she looks forward to something more when she wakes up. Red Hat is not for everyone, but for some women, it is a wake up call and a chance to get out once in awhile. Not all chapters wine and dine as one writer noted.

Years ago, I embroidered and framed the Jenny Joseph poem Warning about becoming independent with age. 

I have absolutely no problem with women forming  a group, society, club, or whatever and meeting to eat and gossip, or read books, or raise money, or gamble. There is no reason that having fun need be considered selfish. 

What bothers me is that ANY group with age limits, dress codes and membership dues should define themselves as the incarnation of Jenny Joesephs poem.

It might amuse you to know that the Red Hat Societys website is not allowed to post Jenny Josphs poem!! That says something about how the writer of the poem really feels about their society.

I think the red-hatters should  find a poem about conformity and rules and use it as their impetus. 

And a note to the person who felt that everyone wears a uniform - when I was in school in the early 70s and everyone wore the same type of clothing, I sewed my own weird pants and tops - I didnt look like anyone else - SO NOT EVERYONE WEARS A UNIFORM  

I still sew my own clothes so I can wear whatever I want, hopefully nothing that is in vogue. Right now, my outfit is usually leggings because theyre so comfortable although probably not so attractive LOL. I will never fit in - - and although Im old enough to be a red-hatter - I will NEVER join - I want to start a non-red hat group - I like blue - how about blue hats? for those who dont belong? . . . hmmm now what should the dress code be for my group???

I am a server in a restaurant that is very popular among the red hat ladies and to be honest I can tell you that the Red Hatters are a nightmare for restaurant staff.  I am not opposed to the idea of the society, but the way they behave in restaurants needs some serious rethinking.  In my experience they are extremely high maintenance customers, frequently behave as if it is funny to confuse and be rude to waitstaff such as myself and they are notoriously low tippers.  To put the icing on the cake they ALWAYS expect me to split their bill in the most ridiculous ways that takes up a lot of time.  When you expect your server to split a 9-customer check among cash and credit cards and split the cost of various desserts, teas and pastries while hes at it, he will be forced to spend time at the computer console figuring it all out with a calculator while he should be attending to other demands, not to mention the line of servers who need that computer to put in orders for the entire restaurant.  I have been forced to give tables in my section to other servers so that my guests will not be neglected in order to make the time to split a bill for a red hat table.

We have an extremly large group, upwards of 80.  We range in age from the low twentys to the mid 90s.  We are every race, religion and economic station.  We do not all dress alike, some dont like to wear purple, alot dont like to wear hats,some of them wear little red hair clips.  No one cares - we have no rules.

Within our group we have a card club, a book club, a gardening club, a dance club, a sewing club, a knitting club and an exercise club.  You can join any of them you like, or none of them if you dont want to.

In addition to a monthly lunch meeting and a monthly evening meeting, which you can attend if you want we have gone on cruises, lots of trips, the theatre, a group has gone white water rafting, riding in a blimp and too many things to list. We have pajama partys, pool parties and just about any other kind of party we can think up.  Again, if you dont want to participate that is fine, you will just miss all the fun. 

Our city has set aside on day a year as Red Hat Society day. We can be and have been involved in charity work and civic organizations but that is done outside of the Red Hat Society.

We have fun and we laugh alot.  If laughter keeps you young we will all live to be 100.  Some are more conservative some more libral, not only in their politics and religous beliefs but in their outlook on life.  There is not much danger of conformity it our group.

I have no idea where you heard that the chapters only get together to drink wine and tell dirty jokes. That is far from the truth. We get together every month for dinner to discuss the activities that are being planned, i.e. theater, cruises, street festivals and any other cultural or worthwhile event. Did you know that most of the chapters do some kind of charitable work for others? There is friendship, support and camaraderie available to all who want to enjoy themselves.

Unfortunately, I can not find anyone who will admit to selling on ebay.  A friend suggested I contact the red  hat society and they could do a raffle.  Fine by me.  I do not know who to contact about my problem.  Can you help?  Either wiht selling on ebay or an e-mail address of the person willing to do a raffle for me.

I lost my niece to stomach cancer this year.  I would like the donation to be made in her name.

I then went online to find out what this society is all about and happened onto this site.  After reading the many opinions and judgements and thoughts expressed, my interest is even more peaked.  Is there an internet site where I might find out more information about individual chapters in my area so that I might better be able to decide whether I want to join it or not?  Actually I think I do want to join a chapter, but not personally knowing any Red Hatters, I would first like to know about a chapters activities and attitude before joining one.  If there isnt one already, perhaps there should be a directory of chapters for each state with contact information.
", '2004-05-19'),(42,"joyce","I am a member of the Red Hatters - something that I enjoy very much. Our group is a singing group and in our town we are very much in demand for entertainment - people really enjoy our cheerful dresses and hats. We do more than meet for lunch - we tour - sing and shop together. We also know that when we need a hand with illness or grief there is one offered, someone who knows us and is a friend, someone who knows our families and will help us thru the rough spots. For me personally I have proved that Red Hats with the added singing actually makes a drastic improvement in my health - singing laughing and friendship makes every medical set back easier to deal with. also we do not always wear dresses - and if someone came to our group with a lime colored dress and orange hat we would have a great laugh - but wearing a red hat and purple clothes is so cheerful and we do get together and dye clothes so we all can wear purple. So just try walking into a room with a sea of red and purple and see if it does not cheer you.

Keeping the idea in mind that I do not have to live the rest of my life by todays way of being is self-empowering. Each new day enriches my perspective of how I want to live.

Having fun for its own sake--if a person finds value in that concept--can take whatever form you wish. Some people like company in this regard, some dont.

We can each decide for ourselves. Now, isnt that something to smile about, regardless of what other people are doing?


", '2004-05-22'),(42,"amanda","I know Im very late to this conversation, but I feel I have to stand up for my grandmother, who happens to be turning 89 today.

She is a member of the Rowan Red Cats of Salisbury, N.C. She is also an active volunteer with the VFW Auxiliary, the American Legion Auxiliary, the local fire house auxiliary, and volunteers at the VA Hospital and state nuring home in Salibury. The Red Hat Society actually gives her a chance to eat out with her friends once a month just for kicks, without having to follow Roberts Rules of Order or have to volunteer any more than she already does. She has earned the right to relax. They wear purple and red because they think its silly, but they dont wear the same purple dress. They follow the spirit of the poem.

Also, just because you join a group doesnt mean youre a conformist. My grandmother was born and raised in the south in the 20s and 30s and just voted for Obama. Although, for the most part, I disagree with her politically Im independent, but lean a bit right, Im so proud of her for voting her conscience and not one way or another because her friends or family did. Her group has northerners, southerners, liberals, conservatives, and although there is not much cultural diversity, thats basically because of circumstance than predjudice.

I wish the author would have done a bit more research before she labeld all the participants as conformists, or wrote incorrect information about the organization. But if that was the case, she probably wouldnt have come out with the same opinion.

I have found friends that are caring..

we join together in bond to help one another.

If you ever belong to a club you may have to wear a uniform, well think of the red dress/purple hat as a uniform. It fun to be different from the old thing in and out. It fun to stay out in a group and say Im having fun.

so until you belong to a group, you may not understand us. Thats ok, for we may not understand you either.

Yes red and purple are the colors but no one wears the same clothing.  There is no uniform.  Like in any other aspect of life there are some negative people but for the most part these are ladies getting together and enjoying life.  They sing, they have the tea parties, they go on trips.  There are fundraisers and sometimes it is just a way to connect to other people and make friends.  I am twenty five years old but I can honestly say I appreciate what the red hatters have to offer.  The poem is a basis of how the group started not a firm dictation of what must be.  These are women who deserve a lot more respect then some of the name calling and negativity.  Plus everyone should know the old andecdote that one bad apple spoils the barrel.  That is not how it should be and sometimes we have to get rid of the bad to find the good.

I am of the Xs, though not by much, having been born in 67.  Sometimes I angrily indulge myself and point my finger at the Boomers, wishing them whats ahead.  But the blame game isnt productive, and Im well aware of that.  In the past two years, I have witnessed three of my elders deteriorate.  Thus, I have been in and out of hospitals and homes, have been to funerals, have seen what many seniors are going through.  To be quite honest, it has shook me up quite a bit--especially this winter, my grandfather died, and winter is rarely kind to me.  I am almost thirty-seven; my grandparents are gone, with the exception of one grandmother who has had Alz. for almost ten years, now.  I know that I was lucky to have had my grandparents as long as I did.  Im getting off track here...

But it occurs to me that perhaps the Xs and Ys will face a similar dilemma--or worse.  So I think your notion of ageing responsibly will need to be embraced universally, across all age groups.  Im not sure...

Your early post about the grandmother in the mirror reminds me of one of the central themes to the poetry of Diane Wakoski.  I wonder if youre familiar with her.  One of the major concerns of Dianes work she was my mentor in grad school is with what it means to be an ageing woman in a culture that worships youth and youthful beauty.  She identifies with the myth of Medea, and her books of poetry weave a personal mythology that allows one to follow the life of her body and mind in much the same way that ones web journal allows.

For much of my youth, I was obsessively suicidal, verily self-destructive, volunteered to go to Vietnam to have Charlie do what I was too chicken to do, lest I wind up in some hell forever and ever; until my early 30s, what I wanted most was to not exist. Even over the last 30 or so years, I have at times wished I could pull the covers over my head so tight I wouldnt wake up the next day, an artifact of depression yielding to despair perhaps. Yet, on the other hand, I am most actively engaged in living my life, as clueless as I am about if often, to the fullest, to be as active in experiencing the good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly as I can. Im also immensely curious as to just how it -- my life -- eventually turns out. It surely has not been boring. Im not so much afraid of death, but like Woody Allen, I just dont want to be there when it happens. I pray for a quick MI, like a couple of dear friends have departed this earthly plane of samsara. Living like your Mom, or like my Dad did the last several years of his life with Alzheimers, is definitely what I fear more than death itself.

Death could be one of three things, I thought.  Death could be a nothingness so you wouldnt feel or sense anything at all.  Or Death is simply a dispersal of molecules back into the earth, air, fire and  water in which case, the physical becomes part of everything that remains.  Or Death is a passage where your consciousness, or life energy or soul survives the physical body.  To me, one of the great consolations of aging is the time one can spend contemplating the larger questions, all of which are mysteries.   Tending to a dying mother can bump you right up against some of those mysteries.  How and why did fatique and resentment suddenly leave you and be replaced by the deep pleasure you write about in Part 5.

As to religion, that is the one topic I do not talk about publicly except in the most glancing manner if Im certain it applies to whatever Im writing. But even then, only in general terms, not personally. Ive always felt that way, but in recent years, as religion has become a political football with so many people wearing their faith on their political sleeves, I am even more convinced that religion is better kept private, or among those with whom one shares similar beliefs.

Im not sure any longer when I discovered blogging. I started perhaps 2-3 years ago keeping an online diary/journal Ive switched sites since; I was aware of blogs before that, Im not sure for how long. I didnt read them often as I had trouble finding ones that interested me, or keeping up with them if I did. Im still not sure that I can actually be said to blog - I dont talk about current events much, I use LiveJournal, etc., etc.

As far as computer proficiency, Im a programmer, and Ive stuck to LiveJournal and other sites of that ilk OpenDiary, for example. The software is designed to make it easy for people who dont know computers, and actually managed not to make it hard for those who do; Ive been pretty happy with it. Its definitely a day-to-day journal; I write about whatevers on my mind, what Ive done, whatever comes up. Mostly. Sometimes I leave strong opinions on current events out - I use the thing to connect with others and Ive found that I dont enjoy people taking issue with that in my journal, or worse, deciding Im not a friend because I posted politics in there. If I feel strongly about something, Ill still put it up, but Im actually pretty cautious about what I do and dont say there.

I dont worry too much about revealing personal information, but generally I dont go out of my way to do so or need to either. I try very hard not to reveal <i>others</i> personal information except where they themselves have or to reveal stuff related to my job, though. As an ethical consideration, since some of my entries complain about my work-day, it seems wise not to include coworkers actual names, or to make it any clearer than my already-unusual industry niche does what company I work for. Everyone has bad days at work. The more responsibility you have, the more stuff you tend to see. But I dont need to make those public posts, or otherwise do things that could cause the company problems even minor ones. The reality is, while I know that its just life that sometimes I will want to complain, if I put those in public and someone found my journal right after I went off on a long post about the incompetence of another programmer in our group who might have just done something to really, really upset me, even though that is definitely NOT the norm at my job, and they knew or figured out my company, the impression would be bad all the same. Add to this the fact that I know some people who could potentially be clients do read my journal, and it just seems advisable not to put that stuff out in the open.

As far as my friends and family, many of them know about my journal, the rest I am not so sure care. My dad has a LiveJournal as well, and my SO, as well as several of my old college buddies and people I know from more recent friendships; they read and comment on my journal, and I do on theirs. Very interleaved. Ive picked up new friends from LJ, many of whom I have become very comfortable with. Theyre not on the level of people Ive known in the real world for years longer - but theyre pretty dear friends. How dear depends, in part, on how often and how deeply they post. People who post less often, and less about themselves, I may admire, like, or be interested by; but I dont think of them as friends, really. Nor are they asking me to, so that works. :

Ive considered a secret blog or journal in which to post those things I dont put in this one for fear of reception, but you know, I really think it would be pretty sparse and boring, and no one would read it or care. In the area of public events, I usually can find someone who said it sooner and better than I would have anyway. ;

I spent a fair bit of time reading and writing on LJ. It uses up time I could do on other things. On the other hand, it gives a lot back. Strong friendships with multiple people I would not easily maintain contact with otherwise Im a lousy letter-writer, or might not have <i>met</i> otherwise. Exposure to information, points of view, and wisdom I would not have found; ideas, books, hobbies, videos being recommended. I love the chance to meet people and learn from them, to pick up information in a way that, once you find people you click with, you know the signal-to-noise ratio is going to be pretty darned good.

For all the same reasons I love it, as well as quite a few that arent <i>my</i> cup of tea, I think blogging is here to say. Lets be honest, lots of people love to write, love to express themselves, love to think others are watching. Now we can go out there and <i>do</i> that, and maybe were even right that theyre watching. Not only that, we can go out there and read, and connect with people and understandings we might otherwise never have encountered.

Which is, in the end, how I come to be commenting on this entry of yours. :

I suspect this will be your main issue. I watched a 70 year old man learn to use the computer and become completely addicted ... and yet still insist I need to turn on the computer first, wait! when I said I would email him. Hed gotten to grips with fax but didnt actually quite see that the internet was different.

When my son was 3 I got a note home from the nursery one day: We had a fun day today. We used the computer and everyone thought it was great. Connor told me I wasnt using the mouse right and ended up running the software for me. I laughed but I was also fairly sure that 1 Connor was right and 2 this was a major hurdle. She was 30 at the time. I strongly suspect she would not consider a blog. I hope Im wrong.

erm, sorry, for the poll:

36

1 watched/read blogs for quite some time but had no theme so wasnt happy starting one I write randomly every day, I just dont want the world to see it : until I found fotolog

2 extremely proficient ran a Web Design team for an ISP so no issue with the technology at all

3 I couldnt see starting a pure blog without a topic; I then used the photographs as a limiting factor, although Im not sure that still holds

4 I check with people close to me before posting their images or posting about them as a general rule. A hard and fast rule with my son who brought the issue to my attention by sneakily taking a photograph of me and posting it, it hit me then that although it was innocuous, it could have been anything and seriously intruded on my personal space.

5 My friends and family know about it but rarely comment. Im more likely to receive feedback via email or a phone conversation. I use my real name.

6 Its a nice outlet for my short stories, losing that would hurt most I think. But I also enjoy the community and the bouncing-off-each-other and, for fotolog, the varied imagery from other people. For whatever reason, it works better for me than a text-based forum like LiveJournal.

7 Yes. Its easy publishing and for many including me, an excuse to publish ramblings without serious effort, as tomorrow it will be gone.

", '2004-07-11'),(65,"jason","Great Site. Interesting post. Ill do my best to give you a general answer to the topics youve raised:

Im a TV presenter in the UK. I host shows about technology and science. I also write articles for magazines about gadgets and gizmos. The problem with TV is that it boils everything down to its lowest common denominator and for me, the wonder of technology is in the very details that TV executives deem too geeky for general consumption. So in part it was a search for a means of expressing my passion for the philosophy of gadgets and light science that lead me to blogging. I have another urge thats driving me, Im sick of conforming; Im really having issues with doing what is expected of me. The freedom of expression that is at the centre of blogging, the downright bare faced irony and thirty something cheek that shines out from so many blogs also attracts me. I hope that what I do with my blog is articulate some of the ideas Im most excited about; concepts as simple as a train journey, on which I use a camera phone or a wireless link; regular strands like Future Perfect Moment in which I talk about the times when I feel the future coming together in front of me; or me dressed as 80s pop icon Kajagoogoo :

I came to the medium via a friend of my fiance. He runs a blog called www.myacelife.com. Its a very funny but personal diary of this guys life and has what I understand to be a very London-centric flavour to it with which I can strongly identify. Our two blogs could not be any more different, but it was his site that introduced me to blogging.

The points you raise regarding blogging oldies are spot on. At the tender age of 35 I am looking at life in a thoroughly new way; its not positive or negative, its just more rounded. I might even be feeling the first tentative steps of wisdom arriving on my relatively young shoulders. This new sense of perspective needs an outlet and the written word that is the beating heart of blogging offers just that.

As for my blogging habits, I post at least twice a week, but I check in with my site and any comments three or four times a day. Id like to post more but I generally spend too much time on posts and run out of time. I try to use photographs whenever possible. I pride myself on the fact that every image on my site is 100% my copyright. My Sony P900 phone is the ideal moblogging tool and offers a quick and easy means of snapping my experiences.

Do I think blogging is here to stay? Yes, without a doubt. Indeed, I am confident we shall all be talked about as the blogging generation, the pioneers of a text based form of expression that defined the turn of the new millenium.

", '2004-07-15'),(65,"carol","Hello Ronni,

I found your blog through my online friend Fran Pullaras blog, Sacred Ordinary.

Ive been blogging for the last 6 months since my daughter showed me her site, but have kept a journal for most of my life. Some of my friends and some of my sisters know of my blog. I have made friends like Fran online through my blog.

I write and post my art and pictures as I feel like. I also post articles I find that I feel would be of interest to others.

I do my own web art and designed my own page as this is part of what I do now: I design headers and logos for online and offline businesses. 

I am extremely comfortable and proficient with computers for the last 20 years or so, when the publishing company I worked for in NYC sent me to IBM school to learn it all, cause they were having a computer system installed.  

I use both my real name and my nick for entries at times. 

I write as much personal info about myself as I feel it relates to the entry that day.   

Oh yes, I am 56 and am always thrilled to find older people blogging since they write well on a variety of topics and can also spell. I also admire the younger ones ability to design an interesting, beautiful looking blog even if what they post is only about their friends and school life. 

Namaste!

My introduction to ageism came like a rude splash of cold water on my 40th birthday, when I went out after work for drinks with my 26-yr-old female friend and three 40+ one in his mid-50s men.  I had not done this kind of casual bar thing for years and was quite excited.  Except, once seated, the men proceeded to completely ignore me and talk to my friend, culminating in one of them asking her to a rock concert.  Not only did I wonder what was wrong with my appearance I had thought I looked better than ever, but I also thought it was the rudest thing Ive ever experienced: to be ignored on my birthday.  

Its gotten worse.  Not with my husband, who is the same age as me:  he still finds me attractive and we are both fairly content and busy with our two kids.  But with my work life -- I am completely ignored in my departments social events, as are the three other 35+ women, even though the older men are included in everything.

The idea is to ignore the cache references and approach experience with the attitude that this is new. You say to yourself, I havent seen it in this way before or I dont really know her. You see things fresh. This quiets the internal dialogue and focuses perception on the thing self and so has the effect of slowing down our subjective sensation of the passage of time. Seconds can seem like minutes or hours. And it is the only really authentic way to experience life. But it takes an effort to experience things this way...as the author points out, almost everyone is in the habit of substituting remembered experience for here-and-now experience. So much easier, but we lose all we have in life, our experience, in the process.

Turning 40 is an event that merely marks in a round number divisible by five what actually begins happening in the later mid-30s or late 30s -- a personal paradigm shift in worldview -- not necessarily in beliefs, but in how one person connects with the world. 

In the first half of life, we are predisposed to seek the meaning of our life externally, a quest supported by narcissistic and materialistic values which guide us to display who we are, what weve accomplished and where were headed. 

However, as midlife nears, we tend to begin looking more to our inner self for life meaning -- and life satisfaction. Of course we each do this in varying degrees, and some not at all. But if we continue seeking life meaning and satisfaction primarily in the external world, we stand a high likelihood of a sad and regret-filled old age. 

So -- the onset of midlife is frequently accompanies by grief -- grief over the passing of the younger, more worldly, spiritually less enriched self. But, as Robert Browning said, we then are ready to experience the best thatis yet to be/the last of life for which the first was made.

Delightful post. Us males have a comparable Grandfather gene that emerged with me in 1997 as this poem relates:

<b>quickening</b>

of late

on streets

or in crowded malls and parks

now that Spring begins its hallowed bloom

my eyes--which used to longingly linger 

scan quickly over suave 40-somethings

or chic shapes still from the retro-60s

of my rapidly graying generation

instead my sight locks

on the small bright faces of toddlers

squirming giggly in parentâs firm grasp

full of translucent shining wonder

reaching out and evoking

a deep embrace of mysterious life

is this some male clock for progeny

biologically ticking for expression

donât think so

with my oldest at 29 and my youngest 16

i have no wish to emulate Picasso or Thurmond

no my energies are stirred by other pursuits

must be some awakening in my psyche

to be called âGrandpopâ

This means no overtime also, even if you work over 40 hours, since you are classified as a part time employee.

Work Hours

Question: How many hours is full-time employment? How many hours is part-time employment?

Answer: The Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer. Whether an employee is considered full-time or part-time does not change the application of the FLSA.

Let me make it clear that I was not incensed by the personal information that your site required. I was amused.
